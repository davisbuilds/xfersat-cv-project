# Comparing Fine-Tuned CNNs on Satellite Imagery

Investigating transfer learning approaches on CNN model architectures for satellite imagery classification.

## Project Overview

This project evaluates transfer learning techniques for satellite imagery classification. It implements convolutional neural networks (ResNet and EfficientNet architectures) pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the EuroSAT dataset, which contains 27,000 labeled RGB and multi-spectral satellite images across 10 classes of land use and land cover. Each class contains 2,000-3,000 geo-referenced images measuring 64Ã—64 pixels with a spatial resolution of 10 meters per pixel. Results demonstrate that full fine-tuning significantly outperforms the frozen backbone approach across all models, highlighting the domain gap between natural images and satellite imagery, and suggesting that features learned on ImageNet require considerable adaptation to transfer effectively to remote sensing applications.

Frozen backbone model test accuracies:

| Model | Accuracy (test) |
| -------- | ------ |
| ResNet18 | 0.8232 |
| ResNet50 | 0.8637 |
| EfficientNet_B0 | 0.8074 |
| EfficientNet_B4 | 0.7452 |

Unfrozen backbone model test accuracies:

| Model | Accuracy (test) |
| -------- | ------ |
| ResNet18 | 0.9664 |
| ResNet50 | 0.9753 |
| EfficientNet_B0 | 0.9827 |
| EfficientNet_B4 | 0.9783 |

## Usage

You can run the project in two ways:

### 1. Using notebooks

Run the notebooks in sequence:

1. First, explore the dataset: `jupyter lab notebooks/01_exploratory_analysis.ipynb`
2. Prepare the data: `jupyter lab notebooks/02_data_preparation.ipynb`
3. Train the models: `jupyter lab notebooks/03_model_development.ipynb`
4. Analyze results: `jupyter lab notebooks/04_evaluation_visualization.ipynb`

### 2. Using command-line scripts

- Train a model with default parameters: `python run.py`
- Train a model with custom parameters: `python main.py --model_name resnet50 --epochs 15 --batch_size 16 --freeze_backbone`

Available options for `main.py`:

- `--model_name`: Model architecture to use (resnet18, resnet50, efficientnet_b0, efficientnet_b4)
